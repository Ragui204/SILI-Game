## Reflection
In this milestone we concluded our game by adding pointers and a score and game over screen to our game. The challenge that I encountered in this milestone was working with almost every function that had to do with object interaction like intersections and filter interaction but the hardest one was the launch projectile one because the test game kept failing even though the game was working. I did not learn anything new exactly but I actually learned something better which was confidence when coding.
